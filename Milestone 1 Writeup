---Accounting (mlm)---
The accounting system for Canterbury Carpet would be put in place to replace Andy's hand written invoices. 
Since Andy has decided to purchase of a rival carpet cleaning company, his customer base as well as traffic is expected to double. 
Because of this, an accounting system would be highly beneficial for Andy's business as he will struggle to keep track of invoices and accounts receivable. 
For a system like this Andy would need a computer, as well as accounting software. In terms of accounting software, it would be a very difficult and expensive
process to create a new one, which would not be economically viable for a small business. Because of this, it would make a lot of sense to 
purchase a licence for an off-the-shelf accounting software. Since Andy will have nearly 200 customers to keep track of, he will need something that will
be able to handle a large number of clients and has the ability to expand in the future.
